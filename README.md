# biomarker

This repository contains FHIR implementation guidance on the representation of a biomarker. A biomarker biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition [(source: cancer.gov)](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker).

The model will apply to more than mCODE and the cancer domain and is intended to apply to other CodeX FHIR accelerator use cases which use biomarkers (e.g.: mCARD).
