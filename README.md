# biomarker

This repository contains FHIR implementation guidance on the representation of a biomarker. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition [(source: cancer.gov)](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker).

## SCOPE
* The model will apply to more than mCODE and the cancer domain and is intended to apply to other CodeX FHIR accelerator use cases which use biomarkers (e.g.: mCARD). 
* The model will address different types of biomarkers, which includes but is not limited to DNA, RNA, chromosomal, and protein level changes.
* Systems using this model can include but is not limited to: genomics sequencing labs, electronic health records (EHRs), pathology reporting systems capturing and interpreting biomarkers as prognostic factors, and reporting registries.
