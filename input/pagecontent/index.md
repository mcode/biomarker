# Biomarkers


This FHIR implementation guide (IG) is a actually a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) analysis of how to comprehensively represent genetic and serum-based prognostic biomarkers. This serves more as a document with computable FHIR examples. Profiles and value sets may be generated but it is secondary and created in support of further analyses. 

Several use cases will be considered and include the following:
* [cancer biomarkers](cancer_biomarker.html) compatible with mCODEâ„¢ (the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements)
* [representation of biomarkers as translated from a College of American Pathologists (CAP) electronic biomarker checklist form to FHIR Observation resources](cap_biomarker.html).
* representation of biomarkers that overlap with the HL7 Clinical Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide

The output of this artifact may be merged into other FHIR IGs like mCODE or the HL7 Clinical Genomics Reporting IG if relevant and appropriate.
